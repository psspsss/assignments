Problem for practice:
	---------------------
	1. Area Calculator
		Create overloaded functions named area() to calculate:
			Area of a square
			Area of a rectangle
			Area of a circle
 
		Requirements
			Same function name
			Different parameter lists
			Use appropriate data types
=======================================================
	2. Simple Interest
			Create a function simpleInterest() with:
				Principal
				Rate (default = 5%)
				Time (default = 1 year)
	3. Power Function
			Create a function power() where:
				Base is mandatory
				Exponent is optional (default = 2)	
	4. Calendar Printer
		Create a function printCalendar() with:
			Day(default = 1)
			Month (default = 12)
			Year (default = 2025)

Problems to Solve:
	------------------
	1. Implement the class Calendar with the given data and methods(functions) as given below.
		class Calendar{
			int day, month, Year;//private by default
		public:
			void setDate(int dd=1, mm=12, int yyyy=2025);
			bool valideDate();
			int dayOfWeek();
			int maxDays();
			bool isLeap();
			void printCalendar();			
		};
	2. 	Implement the class Num with the given data and methods as given below.
		class Num{
			int num;
		public:
			void setNum(int n = 10);
			void dispNum();
			bool isEven();
			bool isPrime();			
		};
	3. 	Implement the class BankAccount with the given data and methods as given below.
		Data:
	    	Account number
			Account holder name
			Balance
        Provide functions to:
			setAccount --> Initial value of number, name and balance, 
        	Deposit money
        	Withdraw money
        	Display balance

Problem 4:
----------
	Define a class MyArray, you provide constructors (default, single parameterized, copy), printArray(), extend(It will add new contents from an existing array).
	class MyArray{
		int arr[100];
		int size;
	public:
		MyArray();
		MyArray(int data);
		MyArray(const MyArray&);
		void printArray();
		void extend(const MyArray&);
	};


notes

C With Classes:

		The concept of Classes was introduced by Bjarne Stroustrup based on his understanding of a Simula. C++ is not the first Object-oriented Programming language. 

		There were other OOP languages like Algol, Simula.

		If a language is said to be an OOP language then it should support all the following 4 key principles.

		Key Principles

        	Abstraction

        	Encapsulation

			Inheritance

        	Polymorphism        	

	======================================================

	Abstraction(Implementation Hiding): 

		Abstraction means showing only the essentail features with clear boundary by hiding the implementation details.

	Encapsulation(Data Hiding):

		Encapsulation is the bundling of data and function that operator on that data into a single unit(Object). while restricting direct access to internal data(using private access specifier).

	Inheritance(Code re-use):

		Inheritance allows a class to inherit (derive) the features(data and functions) of an existing class (Base/Super/Parent). The newly created class is referred to as Derived/Sub/Child class.

		By Inheriting from an existing class, you tend to re-use the existing class.

		Inheritance provide a way of code re-usability by derivation.

	Polymorphism(Many Forms):

		Polymorphism allows the same interface (same name) to behave diffently depending on the object.

		When it comes to inheritance from OOP point of view, It is run-time polymorphism or function/method overriding.

		But for theoritical reasons,

			Indian authors use the term 

			Compile time polymorphism (using function overloading and operator overloading).

			Runtime polymorphism: function overriding using inheritance and virtual functions.

	There are other code re-usable 	terminology in addition to Inheritance, Composition and Aggregation.
