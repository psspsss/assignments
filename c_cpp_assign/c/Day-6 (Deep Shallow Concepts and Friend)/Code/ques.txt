Create a class which a pointer as a data member(you may have other members) with dynamic memory.
	Task:
		Pass object by value to a function
		Track how many times copy constructor is called
		Explain shallow vs deep impact


Remember is a system, CPU is a resource, file is a resource, network is a resource, memory is a resource.

2.  Create a class Resource that has a pointer as a data member that(store these resources as string in a char *ptr):

		Allocates memory dynamically

		Uses default copy behavior

	Task:

		Copy objects

		Destroy them

		Demonstrate double deletion problem

		Fix it using deep copy

Problem #1:
-----------
	Implement a class MyString so that, 
	1. It represents an array of characters which is allocated dynamically 
	2. Perform deep copy by defining default, single parameterized and copy constructor. Also provide destructor.
	Data members:
		char *data;//stores null terminated string  
		unsigned int len;//stores the length 
	Functions:
		default constructor // creates an empty string 
		single parameterized ctor // allocate memory an store the string. 
		copy constructor // Deep copy 
		Destructor 
		unsigned int size()const; //returns length
		const char *cStr()const; //returns data 
		void disp() const; //prints length and data
