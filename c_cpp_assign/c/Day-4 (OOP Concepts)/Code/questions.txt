1. Write a C++ program to declare 3 pointer variables of three different data types and initialize them with their respective variable address. 

		Try copying one type of pointer to another without typecasting.
		
		Try the same program in C. Compare the results.
		

2. Combine the given 2 programs. 
		1. rand() usage and 
		2. dynamic array with user given size.
	Create a dynamic array with user given size, and fill the array with random values using rand(). Print the array.
 
3. 	Use the previous question as data, find the sum and average of the array data.
 
4. Find the largest and smallest number from the 2 question logic.
 
5. Reverse the data stored in dynamic array.
 
6. Sort the dynamic array created with question #2 logic.

7. Try implementing 2 D dynamic array.
8. Insert a new element into a dynamically allocated array(Created using question #2).
	#Remember inserting or deleting at a position needs reallocation/resizing of the memory.
9. Delete an element from dynamically allocated array(Created using question #2).
