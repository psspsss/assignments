1. Are we overloading as member or non-member function(global friend)
			2. Is it Unary or Binary operator 
			3. If Unary and it is a member function, then no argument is necessary.
			If Unary and it is a Non-member function, then one argument is necessary.
			4. If operator is Binary and it is used as a member function then one argument is necessary.
			If overloaded as non-member then both the arguments are to be passed.
