Problem #4:

-----------

	Array Operations System (Abstract Behavior via Inheritance)

Problem Statement

	An array processing system supports different types of arrays such as IntegerArray, FloatArray, and StringArray.

	Each array type performs operations like insert elements and display elements.
 
	Define a base class ArrayBase with virtual methods insert() and display().

	Derived classes must override these methods to handle different data types.

	The program should dynamically create an array object based on user input and perform operations.
 
Concepts Tested

	Polymorphic behavior

	Abstract design using base class

	Runtime method binding
