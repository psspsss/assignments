1. Hello World 
		Create a program that creates a single thread.
		Prints "Hello world from thread"
		Prints "Hello world from main"
	using 
		std::thread 
		join()
	2. get_id() --> Printing ID of the thread.
		Create 3 threads so that they can 
			print its own thread ID using 
				std::this_thread::get_id() 
	3. Print 1 to 10 
		a. passing function as argument 
		b. passing lambda as argument
	4. join & detach 
		Create 2 threads
			one thread is joined 
			one thread is detached 
		task:
			print "hello world" to show execution order 
		Experiment:	
			What happens if main() exits first.
 
	5. Create 5 threads using vector to store thread objects. synchronize with main using join() with all 5 threads

	6. Create an array of 100 elements(global or static array), create 5 threads from main, fill the array elements where each thread fills 20 elements only.
