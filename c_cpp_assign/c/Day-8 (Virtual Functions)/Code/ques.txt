1. Shape Drawing System
 
Shape
|-- Circle
|-- Rectangle
|-- Triangle
 
Requirements:
	Base class Shape with virtual function draw()
	Derived classes override draw()
	Use Shape* to call draw() for different objects
2. Payment Gateway System
 
PaymentMethod
|-- CreditCard
|-- DebitCard
|-- NetBanking 
|-- UPI
 
Requirements:
	PaymentMethod is abstract
	Pure virtual function pay(double amount)
	Demonstrate polymorphism with base pointer
3. Banking Account System
 
Account
|-- SavingsAccount
|-- CurrentAccount
|-- FixedDepositAccount
 
Requirements
	Virtual functions: calculateInterest(), display()
	Use base-class references
	Add virtual destructor

Create the following hierarchy without virtual inheritance:
 
        Person

       /      \

   Student    Employee

       \      /

        Intern

Requirements

	Person has name

	Student has rollNo

	Employee has empId

	Intern inherits from both Student and Employee

Tasks --> Perform before virtual inheritance

	Try accessing name from Intern

	Observe and explain the ambiguity error

	Print object sizes

	Access name unambiguously

	Verify only one Person subobject exists

	Compare memory size before and after	

	Observe constructor call order

	Modify constructors to accept parameters

	Initialize Person correctly from Intern class
